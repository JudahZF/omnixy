# Getting Started

This short guide helps you pick the right path and complete a first install.

## Prerequisites
- 64-bit Linux host.
- For Nix path: recent Nix/NixOS, or use the NixOS installer ISO. Comfortable with flakes.
- For Arch path: an existing Arch install with `sudo`, internet, and basic tooling.

## Which path should I choose?
- Prefer Nix if you want reproducible configs, easy upgrades, and the primary supported experience.
- Use Arch only if you need the frozen Omarchy scripts and accept no new features.

## Next steps
- Nix: go to [Nix Install](./nix/install.md) and follow the flake-based setup.
- Arch: go to [Arch Install](./arch/install.md) and use the legacy scripts.

After installation, explore:
- [Commands](../docs/commands/README.md) for CLI helpers
- [Themes](../docs/themes/README.md) to customize the look
